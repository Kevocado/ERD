## **Entity Relationships**

* Customer and Invoice: 1–M  
  Each customer may generate multiple invoices; each invoice belongs to one customer.  
* Invoice and Product: M–M  
  Each invoice may include multiple products, and each product can appear on multiple invoices.  
* Shipping and Customer: 1–M  
  Each shipping record pertains to one customer, and each customer can be associated to multiple shipping IDs  
* Order and Customer: 1–1  
  Each order is tied to a single customer, and each customer can have multiple back orders  
  * There is a boolean column called backorder than decides if the order is a backorder or not  
* Shipping and Product: 1–M  
  Each shipment can include multiple products, but each product in a shipment is linked to only one shipping record.  
* Manufacturer and Product: 1–M  
  One manufacturer can produce many products, while each product is made by only one manufacturer.

**Business Rules**

* A customer may place many orders.  
* Each order is generated by only one customer.  
* Some customers have not (yet) placed an order  
* An order cannot be shipped until the invoice is paid  
* One manufacturer can have multiple products.  
* Each product is manufactured by only one manufacturer.  
* One shipment can include multiple products but only one customer.  
* Each shipping record belongs to one customer.  
* If backorder is True, no invoice is generated

## **Assumptions**

* All shipped orders have been paid for.  
* Each product is associated with only one manufacturer.  
* Customers without invoices may still exist in the database (potential or new customers).  
* A backorder represents pending or unfulfilled orders for a single customer.  
* Any customer who we have information about remains a customer if they make an order within a year
